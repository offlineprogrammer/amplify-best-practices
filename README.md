# Amplify Best Practices and Reference Guide

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to using AWS Amplify Gen 2 effectively. It includes detailed instructions, examples, and best practices for modeling data relationships, setting up schemas, and configuring authentication.

## Overview
The guide is designed for developers building applications with AWS Amplify Gen 2. It consolidates:
- Data modeling techniques (e.g., one-to-many, one-to-one relationships)
- Schema rules for accurate configuration
- Authentication setup with external providers and custom attributes

## File Contents
The primary file in this repository is:
- **`Amplify_Reference_and_Best_Practices.md`**: A complete markdown guide covering:
  - Modeling relationships in Amplify
  - Schema rules and examples
  - Authentication configuration with rules and syntax

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/amplify-best-practices.git
   cd amplify-best-practices
   ```

2. Open **`Amplify_Reference_and_Best_Practices.md`** to explore the guide.

3. Integrate the file into your project for Amazon Q workspace context:
   - **Step 3.1: Add the Markdown File to Your Project:**
     - Copy the `Amplify_Reference_and_Best_Practices.md` file into your project directory. For example:
       ```
       src/docs/Amplify_Reference_and_Best_Practices.md
       ```

   - **Step 3.2: Enable Workspace Indexing in Amazon Q:**
     - Open the Amazon Q Developer Chat in your IDE or browser.
     - Type `@workspace` to enable workspace indexing.
     - Amazon Q will guide you through enabling indexing for your project's directory. Follow the prompts.

   - **Step 3.3: Verify File Indexing:**
     - After indexing, test that the markdown file is included by running a query like:
       ```bash
       @workspace search "Schema rules for enums"
       ```
     - If the file is not indexed, ensure the file is stored in the correct directory and indexing has been completed.

   - **Step 3.4: Use the File in Queries:**
     - Once indexed, you can reference the markdown file content in your queries to Amazon Q. Examples:
       ```bash
       @workspace Explain the relationships in src/docs/Amplify_Reference_and_Best_Practices.md
       ```
       ```bash
       @workspace What are the authentication rules in Amplify_Reference_and_Best_Practices.md?
       ```

   - **Step 3.5: Keep the File Updated:**
     - If you update the file, ensure the workspace index is refreshed by triggering a re-indexing in Amazon Q:
       ```bash
       @workspace refresh
       ```

## Example Use Case
You can use this guide to:
- Design data models with proper relationships and authorization.
- Implement secure authentication flows with external providers.
- Follow Amplify Gen 2's best practices to avoid common pitfalls.
